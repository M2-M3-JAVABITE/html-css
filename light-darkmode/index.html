        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5
            February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi
            Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of
            all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year
            Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 34 trophies in his career,
            including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA
            Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the
            Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international
            appearances (205). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the
            most by an outfield player, and has scored over 850 official senior career goals for club and country,
            making him the top goalscorer of all time.</p>

        <p>Ronaldo has said that he does not drink alcohol,[603] and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror
            article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008.[625]
            He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.[626]</p>
